**General rules for an ideal session**

- We should keep our camera on and in a proper angle, so that the session remains interactive and productive.
- We should either avoid or speak cautiously and responsibly on sensitive topics like sex, religion, politics, etc.
- We should always give applause by waving hands or signing claps.
