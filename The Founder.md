## <p align="center">The Founder</p>

**A brief overview**
The movie revolves around how McDonald's transformed from being a pretty much local restuarant to a massive franchise, all because of the ambition and persistence of Ray Kroc, along with a ruthlessness nature towards the McDonald brothers. I won't write about the plot here, as it's available everywhere, rather I will point out the key learnings or messages from the movie.

**Lessons/Messages**
- Persistence is the key to success. Ray succeeded in his mission because he was persistent no matter what bad happened to him.
- Sky is the limit. McDonald brothers were limiting their thoughts as well as actions, so they couldn't succeed much, whereas Ray explored all the possible ways, expanded his ideas and turned them into action without any limitations, which led to his kind of overnight success.
- Quality is a very important thing. We must maintain the best of the qualities, so as to achieve our goals. One of the major reasons behind McDonald's' success is their product quality, which is always maintained as per the standards.
- Communication and story-telling skills are two of the most required skills in today's world. Apart from having a massive vision, what helped Ray succeed in his dream is his ability to tell a compelling story, so as to persuade the people infront of him.

**What I didn't like**
I didn't like the fact how Ray Kroc exploited the McDonald brothers, his attitute towards them in the last is not acceptable for me atleast. He didn't keep his promise of giving 1% annual royalty over the handshake deal, and even refused to give credits to the brothers as co-founders of McDonaldâ€™s, even though they were the original founders.
